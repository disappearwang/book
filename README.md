# Preface

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Welcome to the Jtwig Reference Manual. This book is intended to be used as documentation support for Jtwig (http://jtwig.org), a templating language specifically designed for web development.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I have started this book with the main reason to add good documentation support to Jtwig, but also to study the language and therefore improving it by providing a consistent view.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Although Jtwig is based on Twig, which is a well known language, heavily used by thousands of developers, studying the differences between them and even the differences to other templating engines allowed me to discover interesting factors when deciding which template language to use in specific scenarios. Specially, how much that choice affects the different phases rendering a page and the system architecture.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
If you do not know which template language to choose, I would highly recommend you to read the first chapter of this book.

## Audience

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This book can be read by anyone knowledgeable about web development. Java language is also a nice to have, but only for advanced chapters of this book.
