# Preface

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Welcome to the Jtwig Reference Manual. This book is intended to be used as documentation support for Jtwig (http://jtwig.org), a templating language specifically designed for web development.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I have started this book with the main reason to add good documentation support to Jtwig, but also to study the language and improve it to provide a consistent view around it.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Although Jtwig is based on Twig, which is already heavily used by thousands of developers, studying the differences between them and even other templating engines allowed me to discover interesting important factors when deciding which template language to use in a given scenario.

## Audience

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This book can be read by anyone knowledgeable about web development. Java language is also a nice to have, but only for advanced chapters of this book.
