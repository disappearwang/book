# Syntax

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Jtwig is a Twig port to Java, however, it does not support all Twig features and also includes functionality Twig does not offer. Syntax wise, they do also differ. This difference is due to Java environment specifics. To allow the engine to take full advantage of its mother language, some fundamental changes were introduced. Within this section one will detail Jtwig syntax, making a comparison, whenever sensible, with Twig.
